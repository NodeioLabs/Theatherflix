Theatherflix Extension is a browser extension that provides personalized movie and series recommendations to users. Using The Movie Database (TMDb) API, the extension fetches popular movie data and displays customized suggestions based on user preferences. By leveraging TMDb's extensive movie and series information, users can discover exciting titles and find their next favorite entertainment without the need for a Netflix API. The extension offers a seamless and enjoyable browsing experience, making it an ideal companion for movie enthusiasts looking to explore diverse content.

Theaterflix is a browser extension that provides personalized movie and series recommendations. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it leverages the TMDb API to fetch data about movies and TV shows. Users can configure the extension by entering their TMDb API key. In the future, we plan to enhance the recommendation system with machine learning and expand compatibility to other browsers. The goal is to create a seamless and delightful user experience for discovering new content based on individual preferences.

The extension uses JavaScript to handle user interactions, such as displaying and hiding the configuration section using an accordion-style UI. It also fetches data from the TMDb API asynchronously and dynamically updates the UI with the fetched information.

In the future, this project aims to incorporate advanced machine learning algorithms to deliver even more accurate and personalized movie and series recommendations. It will expand its reach to support multiple browsers, catering to a broader user base. Continuous updates and improvements will be implemented to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and user preferences. The ultimate goal is to become a go-to tool for entertainment discovery, providing users with an engaging and effortless content exploration experience.

#### 🚀 Project Transition: From Movie Trailer Organizer to Personalized Streaming Extension 🎬

Theatherflix was initially conceived as a visual tool for organizing digital movie trailers, sorting and listing the top latest movie trailers. 🎥 The main objective was to provide a comprehensive platform that catered to individuals with limited internet access or no subscription to streaming services. 🌐 The project aimed to offer a complete, free-to-use platform that could be installed on various servers, computers, or devices to watch movie trailers.

However, we have recently undergone a transition in our project's focus. 🔄 We are now developing Theatherflix as a browser extension. The new vision for Theatherflix is to create an extension that provides personalized movie and series recommendations, enhancing the user's streaming experience with tailored content suggestions. 📺🍿

By shifting to an extension-based approach, we aim to offer a seamless integration with popular streaming platforms like Netflix. 🎉 Users will be able to receive personalized recommendations directly within their browser while using Netflix, making it easier for them to discover new content they might enjoy.

We believe this transition will better serve our users, as it allows for a more direct and user-friendly interaction with the streaming platforms they are already using. 🤝 We are committed to continuous development and will keep updating the extension to meet the evolving needs and preferences of our users.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to work on Theatherflix Extension and improve its functionality to provide the best personalized streaming recommendations for our users. 👀

Thank you for being a part of this exciting journey with us! 🙌 If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to contribute or reach out to us. Together, let's make streaming entertainment more enjoyable for everyone. 🎉🍿

#### Technical stuff*:

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      If you are one of the engineers, developers, someone documenting or a tester, don't forget there's a branch called 'development'. We must use that first before to make a pull request to the master. 
      Create any issue about moving files etc. We in that way can avoid any kind of conflict regarding files or programming.
      Thanks!

#### Development

**Don't write initially in the master branch, all first goes to development**. then we pull request to master which is 'Production'.
If you want to download the whole development files, go to the 'development' branch -> 
https://github.com/NymexData/Theatherflix/tree/development

#If you want to clone the development branch follow this:
1. `git clone -b development --single-branch git@github.com:NymexData/Theatherflix.git`
2. `cd development` (which is downloaded as a folder named 'Theatherflix' though, you rename it)

| We need more collaborations or people involved in this modest project which I think it could be cool, actualy initially behind Theatherfli there was a different idea, but now,  we have a different idea, I hope this new concepto for the project could work :).

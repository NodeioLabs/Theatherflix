Theatherflix Extension is a browser extension that provides personalized movie and series recommendations to users. Using The Movie Database (TMDb) API, the extension fetches popular movie data and displays customized suggestions based on user preferences. By leveraging TMDb's extensive movie and series information, users can discover exciting titles and find their next favorite entertainment without the need for a Netflix API. The extension offers a seamless and enjoyable browsing experience, making it an ideal companion for movie enthusiasts looking to explore diverse content.

### 🚀 Project Transition: From Movie Trailer Organizer to Personalized Streaming Extension 🎬

Theatherflix was initially conceived as a visual tool for organizing digital movie trailers, sorting and listing the top latest movie trailers. 🎥 The main objective was to provide a comprehensive platform that catered to individuals with limited internet access or no subscription to streaming services. 🌐 The project aimed to offer a complete, free-to-use platform that could be installed on various servers, computers, or devices to watch movie trailers.

However, we have recently undergone a transition in our project's focus. 🔄 We are now developing Theatherflix as a browser extension. The new vision for Theatherflix is to create an extension that provides personalized movie and series recommendations, enhancing the user's streaming experience with tailored content suggestions. 📺🍿

By shifting to an extension-based approach, we aim to offer a seamless integration with popular streaming platforms like Netflix. 🎉 Users will be able to receive personalized recommendations directly within their browser while using Netflix, making it easier for them to discover new content they might enjoy.

We believe this transition will better serve our users, as it allows for a more direct and user-friendly interaction with the streaming platforms they are already using. 🤝 We are committed to continuous development and will keep updating the extension to meet the evolving needs and preferences of our users.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to work on Theatherflix Extension and improve its functionality to provide the best personalized streaming recommendations for our users. 👀

Thank you for being a part of this exciting journey with us! 🙌 If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to contribute or reach out to us. Together, let's make streaming entertainment more enjoyable for everyone. 🎉🍿

#### Technical stuff*:

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      If you are one of the engineers, developers, someone documenting or a tester, don't forget there's a branch called 'development'. We must use that first before to make a pull request to the master. 
      Create any issue about moving files etc. We in that way can avoid any kind of conflict regarding files or programming.
      Thanks!

#### Development** vs Production (The master branch)

**Don't write initially in the master branch, all first goes to development**. then we pull request to master which is 'Production'.
If you want to download the whole development files, go to the 'development' branch -> 
https://github.com/NymexData/Theatherflix/tree/development

#If you want to clone the development branch follow this:
1. `git clone -b development --single-branch git@github.com:NymexData/Theatherflix.git`
2. `cd development` (which is downloaded as a folder named 'Theatherflix' though, you rename it)
2. `npm install` (We can use Yarn too)
3. node (or nodemon) server.js 


#### Clone the project 

#If you want to clone the old branch follow this:
1. `git clone -b development --single-branch git@github.com:NymexData/Theatherflix.git`
2. `cd Theatherflix`
2. `npm install` (We can use Yarn too)
3. node (or nodemon) server.js

#### Github notes for Engineers & Developers
Before any commit, don't forget this: (or we could lose all the work that other engineers and developers in the project could have done)
1. `git pull`

2. `git add .` (your contribution.)
3.  your contribution - commits ...


#### Installation

1. Make sure you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Versions 6.0.0 and higher should work. We recommend that you use the most-recent "Active LTS" version of Node.js.
2. Make sure you have installed `npm` (NB: `npm` is distributed with Node.js- which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer).   

#### Check that you have node and npm installed

- To check if you have Node.js installed, run this command in your terminal:

`node -v`

- To confirm that you have npm installed you can run this command in your terminal:

`npm -v`

#### Quick Start

1. `sudo npm install` (You can also use Yarn)
2. `node server.js` (recommend install nodemon)
3. Open <http://localhost:3000>


#### Developers 

If you want to run the latest code from git, here's how to get started:

1. Clone the code:

        git clone git@github.com:NymexData/theatherflix.git
        cd theatherflix

2. Install the theatherflix dependencies

        npm install (You can also use Yarn)

3. Build the code

        npm run build

4. Run

        npm start
   or

        node server.js
